# Solar-Panels-power-Output-Prediction
This study investigates alternative methods of predicting solar panel power generation without relying on irradiance data, with the aim of improving efficiency and reducing resource expenditure while maintaining accuracy. The K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm is utilized as a predictive model, and its performance is compared with the Random Forest (RF) technique. The results suggest that both KNN and RF can provide reliable predictions without the need for irradiance data. However, RF outperforms KNN in terms of prediction accuracy. These findings demonstrate the potential of RF as a viable alternative to conventional methods and highlight the significance of machine learning in the field of solar energy. The application of this approach may offer a promising solution to reduce the dependence on expensive and time-consuming irradiance measurements in solar energy production, leading to significant time and cost savings.
